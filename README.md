Vulcan
==================

Vulcan is an online PCB editor. Most other editors use a grid-based routing system, but Vulcan uses a funky topographic 
algorithm for routing the traces. (Think of rubber bands stretched around obstacles like pads or other traces.) As a 
pleasant side effect, using topographic routing should also allow me to implement cool stuff like push-aside routing 
and auto-complete.
