The Stretch Router
==================

The Stretch Router is an online PCB editor. Most other editors use a grid-based routing system, but The Stretch 
Router uses a funky topographic algorithm for routing the traces. (Think of rubber bands stretched around obstacles
like pads or other traces.) As a pleasant side effect, using topographic routing should also allow me to implement 
cool stuff like push-aside routing and auto-complete. 

... Why isn't there anything in the repository?
===============================================

As part of my internship last summer I built a web application using fun new technologies like WebRTC and HTML5 APIs. 
I had a great time and learned a lot, but by the end of the summer I was spending most of my time refactoring the 
program architecture. Moral of the story: specifications and architecture plans are Good Things. That's what I'm
working on at the moment.

Also: my honors project is due soon and nothing is working and I've got to write a treasurer's report and there's 
exams to study for as well as finding a job and the sky is falling and where did all my time go?
