<p>The Stretch Router is an online PCB editor. Most other editors use a grid-based routing system, but The Stretch Router uses a funky topographic algorithm for routing the traces. (Think of rubber bands stretched around obstacles like pads or other traces.) As a pleasant side effect, using topographic routing should also allow me to implement cool stuff like push-aside routing and auto-complete.</p>
