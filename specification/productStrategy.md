This file will discuss issues concerning the high-level purpose and strategy of Vulcan.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### What is the primary purpose of this project? Do I want to try to make money?

There are many purposes that I could work towards, and each attracts me to some degree. I want to demonstrate my skills, improve the state of free tools, explore new approaches to circuit design, and make enough money to give me some freedom. 

The first three purposes all lead in the same direction. I would make all my code open-source, and I would attempt to build a community around my project. I would focus first on exploring interesting concepts, but I would also take the time to build out features that people request. 

If I focused on creating a sustainable business, I would need to keep my core code private. I could still pursue interesting concepts (and these would become differentiating features), but I would need to put more effort into making a well-rounded product. For example, I might need to build a traditional schematic capture product before spending the time to build a DSL and parser. 

It seems that the best approach is to focus on the first three purposes (demonstrating skills, improving free tools, and exploring new approaches). I will hopefully be able to make money in the following ways:
- Provided a hosted version of the project. There will be free accounts, but also tiered plans. (Note that anyone would be able to clone the project and host their own editor.)
- Use the project to get contract work.
