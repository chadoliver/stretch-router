This file will discuss issues concerning the high-level purpose and strategy of Vulcan.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### What is the primary purpose of this project? Do I want to try to make money?

There are many purposes that I could work towards, and each attracts me to some degree. I want to demonstrate my skills, improve the state of free tools, explore new approaches to circuit design, and make a small amount of money. 

The first three purposes all lead in the same direction. I would make all my code open-source, and I would attempt to build a community around my project. I would focus first on exploring interesting concepts, but I would also take the time to build out features that people request. 

If I focused on creating a sustainable business, I would need to keep my core code private. I could still pursue interesting concepts (and these would become differentiating features), but I would need to put more effort into making a well-rounded product. For example, I might need to build a traditional schematic capture product before spending the time to build a DSL and parser. 

It seems that the best approach is to focus on the first three purposes (demonstrating skills, improving free tools, and exploring new approaches). I will hopefully be able to make money in the following ways:
- Provided a hosted version of the project. There will be free accounts, but also tiered plans. (Note that anyone would be able to clone the project and host their own editor.)
- Use the project to get contract work.

It important to note that I have no interest in building a startup around this (or any other) product. I value my quality of life too highly for that.

#### Should schematic capture be done with a graphical editor or a hardware description language?

Hardware description language are used a lot in IC design, because they provide powerful tools for managing complexity. However, all schematic capture applications for PCB design use a graphical interface. This presents an interesting trade-off: the traditional interface that everyone knows how to use, or the powerful interface that makes it easier to manage complexity?

If I started with a graphical editor, I would present Vulcan as a product suitable for inexperienced users. These users are unlikely to be interested in a HDL. However, if I started with HDL schematics, I could probably get a few dedicated users by branding my product as a radical rethink of the whole design process. I could build a solid niche product on this branding, and it would be straightforward enough to expand downmarket at a later time.
